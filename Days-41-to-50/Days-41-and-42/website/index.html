                    I obtained a certificate in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/2f2a82555820972be6556fc5a11ae6f252bed2f6e3daf9f2199bfa1f42c5f9d7" target="_blank">Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</a> via LinkedIn course. In this course, I learned how to apply core OOP principles like inheritance and composition along with some Python-specific features like “magic” methods and data classes to build programs that are extensible and efficient. Begun by brushing up on some object-oriented basics, and then use Python features like magic methods to make your classes integrate tightly with the Python language and data classes to dramatically reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to build data-centric objects.
